# Blockies

This library is an Objective-C implementation of the [Ethereum fork of Blockies](https://github.com/ethereum/blockies) which is intended to be used in iOS, watchOS, tvOS and macOS apps. And the code is literally translated from [BlockiesSwift](https://github.com/Boilertalk/BlockiesSwift).

Blockies generates unique images (identicons) for a given seed string. Those can be used to create images representing an Ethereum (or other Cryptocurrency) Wallet address or really anything else.
